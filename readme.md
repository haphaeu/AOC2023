# AOC2023

My lazy code for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) challenges for 2023.

Coding paradigm: pragmatic, legibility ie:

 - code it as fast as possible,
 - but keeping some basic house keeping rules
 - minimum documentation and style
 - stick to the [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python), unless not ;)
